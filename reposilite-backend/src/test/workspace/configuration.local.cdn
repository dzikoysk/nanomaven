# Max amount of threads used by core thread pool (min: 5)
# The web thread pool handles first few steps of incoming http connections, as soon as possible all tasks are redirected to IO thread pool.

# Because most of tasks are redirected to IO thread pool, it might be a good idea to keep it at least equal to web thread pool.
