# Note: It might be hard to estimate the best amount of threads for your use case,
# but you can safely increase amount of threads if needed and Reposilite will create only as much as it needs.
# This option might be more useful to limit available memory resources to minimum (1 thread requires around 200kb to 1MB of memory)

# By default, Reposilite 3.x uses experimental reactive mode to maximize performance of each spawned thread.
# If you've noticed various unresolved behaviours like freezing and deadlocking, you can switch to the standard blocking mode.
# Remember: Blocking mode requires more resources (threads) to handle the same throughput.
