Host JavaDoc pages automatically using JAR files (`*-javadoc.jar`) located in repositories.
Javadoc file is extracted during the first request to `$working-directory/javadocs` directory.

To access javadocs, you have to visit `repo.domain.com/javadoc/<gav>`. 
For instance, using Reposilite Javadocs:

* [panda-lang repository / reposilite-3.0.0-alpha.23 javadocs](https://repo.panda-lang.org/javadoc/releases/org/panda-lang/reposilite/3.0.0-alpha.23/)
