# UI

We want to try to build a "simple" UI using JTE (compiled) + HTMX + TailwindCSS + JS (client-side, JSDoc only).
The color scheme should be +/- the same as the current one.

## Views

1. Setup database (SQLite: local no credentials, Remote: PostgreSQL/MySQL credentials)
2. Setup admin account
3. Finish

### Home page

1. Logo
2. Search bar
3. Pinned projects
4. Repositories

### Login

1. Via credentials / SSO

### Dashboard
